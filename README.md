Claveefy: bringing together true lovers of music

Both people that wish to learn a new instrument and people looking for teaching opportunities can use the platform to book music lessons. 

Prospect students can search for teachers of their desired instrument and utilize additional filters by skill level, city etc. Having chosen a particular teacher students have the ability to view teachers’ profiles and the available dates and request to book a lesson. 

Teachers are able to set their availability for providing classes, review students’ profiles and accept lesson requests. For both user groups there is an additional option to communicate via a private chat.
